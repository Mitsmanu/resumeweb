## Hand in

Drop this folder into your Markbot application. Make sure to fix all the errors. And submit to Canvas using Markbot.

**When you submit, Markbot will give you `1` or `F`—that’s just so you know that it was handed in on Canvas.** You’ll still have to write a *Request for Grade* and the teacher will still be grading it personally.
